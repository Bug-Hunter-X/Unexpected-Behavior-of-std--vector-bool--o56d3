std::vector<bool> is not the same as `std::vector<char>` or other `std::vector` types.  It's specialized to save space, but this specialization causes surprising behavior. It often breaks code that expects the standard `std::vector` interface.  For example, accessing elements with pointer arithmetic may not work as expected, and it can interact unexpectedly with algorithms that assume a contiguous array of bytes.
